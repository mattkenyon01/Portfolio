            This project was completed as a dissertation at Newcastle University and was received very positively. It achieved a high First Class, with strong marks across each section. It was praised by health professionals for its thorough research into both targeted muscle engagement and cognitive benefits — including the use of colour theory to enhance memory — plus accessibility-focused design and comprehensive performance and progress tracking.

        <p>
            There are 8 minigames for the patient to try. They are separated into 4 groups, with 2 unique movements
            targeted at each muscle in the hand. Three games are randomly chosen each time the user plays, so each experience
            is different and kept entertaining and varied.

            The instructions for each game are shown beforehand, with diagrams to make it easy to play. These are presented
            until the user clicks or says “Play,” which will then start the game. The user also has the option to pause the game
            or replay using voice controls.
